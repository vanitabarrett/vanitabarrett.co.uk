Castle Street Clinic required a newly designed website to replace their outstart_dated one, which users found difficult to navigate. The redesign splits the extensive information into more easily digestible chunks. The old site also featured a lot of pale yellow text, failing WCAG colour contrast requirements. The new design still makes strong use of the company branding, introducing the logo to the landing page, but fixes those accessibility issues.
