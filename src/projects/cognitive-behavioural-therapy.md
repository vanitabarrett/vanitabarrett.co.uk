A secure android and web application, demonstrating how current technology could be used to increase and improve communications between patients and healthcare professionals, specifically in the area of mental health and cognitive behavioural therapy. Users would be signed up for an account by their healthcare professional and could use the android app to enter into their mood diary. This information was securely stored in an encrypted database and could be viewed only by that patient's doctor/therapist via the web admin interface.

Uses the following technologies:

- Java
- Android Fingerprint Authentication API
- HTML
- SASS
- jQuery
- CanvasJS
- nodeJS
- PostgreSQL
- Data Encryption (AES-GCM)
