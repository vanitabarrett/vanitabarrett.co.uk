# Project: Denmark Street Big Band

[denmarkstreetbigband.co.uk](https://denmarkstreetbigband.co.uk/)

Denmark Street Big Band had been using the same Wordpress template which didn't fit their needs as it didn't let them highlight the most important information on the homepage. The workarounds which had to be used were cluttering up the page and making it very difficult to make sense of. This redesign puts information in priority order on the page, with a custom slideshow at the top so that band leader, Paul Burch, can specify what to feature at the top. There is also a renewed focus on the band's music, making their Youtube videos and Soundcloud recordings more prominent. Site developed by [Andy Smith](https://andyms.uk/).
