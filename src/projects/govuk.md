Primarily, my role as a frontend developer on GOV.UK involved building new templates and components, taking outcomes from user research and accessibility audits and turning them into actionable developer stories, enhancing the accessibility of GOV.UK and working with other frontend developers to consolistart_date and improving the frontend architecture across GOV.UK

In my time on GOV.UK I worked on multiple teams focusing on different areas of the site, including:

- ensuring GOV.UK meets the international WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standard
- leading teams developing a business-focused tool for EU Exit and improving email notifications
- heavily involved in the build and iteration of Brexit/Transition and Coronavirus campaign pages
- leading development of gov.uk/ask (now offline) during the COVID-19 crisis
- a new site-wide cookie consent mechanism

Uses the following technologies:

- HTML
- SASS
- BEM
- JavaScript
- Ruby on Rails
- Mustache
- Jasmine
- RSpec
- MiniTest
