# Project: List Management

The site uses a populated database of all 1001 books, UNESCO world heritage sites and countries, as well as providing the option for user-specified additions. A user can mark an item as 'Wishlist', 'Not Started', 'In Progress' or 'Completed'. The application has been built in an expandable way, using EJS components and generalised logic so adding a new list is relatively simple.

Uses the following technologies:

- HTML
- SASS
- JavaScript
- MySQL
- NodeJS
- EJS
- Interactive SVGs
- ChartJS
