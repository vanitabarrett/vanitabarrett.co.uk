# Project: {{ name }}

<strong>{{ role }}</strong>

Siyan's existing website wasn't doing a good job of showcasing what the company do and the events they are involved in. On top of that, the website performed poorly from an accessibility point-of-view, with extremely low colour contrast that in places made the text impossible to read. With a logo and colour scheme, I created a site that better reflects Siyan's branding. Site developed by [Andy Smith](https://andyms.uk/)
