Calvin required a website for the new sushi restaurant he was opening in Guildford town centre. He took a very laid-back approach, providing only the company logo and a request that the site be 'bold and exciting'. The site featured: animated SVG icons; custom CMS; social media and news feed, and custom styling of Google Maps.

Uses the following technologies:

- HTML
- SASS
- Animated SVGs
- jQuery
- RequireJS
- Mustache
- PHP
- MySQL
